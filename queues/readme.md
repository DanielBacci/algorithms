### **Queues**

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. The first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed, similar to a real-world queue (e.g., a line at a grocery store).

---

### **Memory Structure of Queues**

1. **Dynamic Nature**:
   - A queue can be implemented using an **array** (fixed size) or a **linked list** (dynamic size).
   - Arrays require contiguous memory, while linked lists use non-contiguous memory with pointers.

2. **Growth and Shrinkage**:
   - **Array-based Queue**: May require resizing if the queue grows beyond the fixed capacity.
   - **Linked List-based Queue**: Dynamically grows and shrinks, but each node requires extra memory for pointers.

### **Operations and Big O Complexity**

| **Operation**         | **Description**                                       | **Time Complexity** |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `enqueue(element)`     | Adds an element to the back of the queue.             | \( O(1) \)           |
| `dequeue()`            | Removes the element from the front of the queue.      | \( O(1) \)           |
| `peek()` or `front()`  | Returns the front element without removing it.        | \( O(1) \)           |
| `isEmpty()`            | Checks if the queue is empty.                         | \( O(1) \)           |
| `size()`               | Returns the number of elements in the queue.          | \( O(1) \)           |

### **Memory Usage**

#### Array-Based Queue:
- **Memory Overhead**: Minimal, as it only stores data.
- **Resizing Cost**: If resizing is required, a new array is allocated, and elements are copied (\( O(n) \) for resizing).
- **Circular Queue Optimization**: Prevents the need for shifting elements during dequeuing by reusing array space.

#### Linked List-Based Queue:
- **Memory Overhead**: Each node requires additional memory for a pointer to the next node.
- **Dynamic Size**: Grows and shrinks without resizing overhead.

---

### **Key Features**

1. **FIFO Behavior**:
   - The first element added is the first one removed.
   - No direct access to elements in the middle of the queue.

2. **Efficient for Sequential Processing**:
   - Tasks that require elements to be processed in the order they arrive.

---

### **Common Use Cases**

1. **Task Scheduling**:
   - Used in operating systems for managing tasks or processes (e.g., Round-Robin scheduling).

2. **Data Buffering**:
   - Used in scenarios where data is produced and consumed at different rates (e.g., I/O buffers, network data packets).

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Essential for BFS in graphs or trees.

4. **Print Queue**:
   - Manages jobs sent to a printer in the order they are received.

5. **Customer Service or Line Simulation**:
   - Models real-world waiting lines where the first person in line is served first.

---

### **Types of Queues**

1. **Simple Queue**:
   - Standard FIFO behavior.

2. **Circular Queue**:
   - Reuses empty space in the array to optimize memory usage.

3. **Priority Queue**:
   - Elements are dequeued based on priority, not just the order they were enqueued.
   - Implemented using **heaps** or **balanced trees**.

4. **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**:
   - Allows insertion and removal from both ends of the queue.

### **Comparison with Other Data Structures**

| **Aspect**           | **Array-Based Queue**        | **Linked List-Based Queue**         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Memory Usage**      | Lower (no extra pointers)    | Higher (due to pointers)           |
| **Resizing**          | Requires reallocation        | Dynamic resizing without overhead  |
| **Performance**       | \( O(1) \) for all operations | \( O(1) \) for all operations      |

---

### **When to Use Queues**

- For **FIFO** tasks like buffering or sequential processing.
- Use **array-based queues** for lower memory overhead and predictable size.
- Use **linked list-based queues** for dynamic sizes and frequent resizing.
